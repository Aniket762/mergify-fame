<h1 align='center'> Mergify Masters </h1>

<p align="justify">
Combining the individual work of an enormous team of engineers into one codebase is tough. And the difficulty lies deeper than our 
standard merge conflicts, which version control is fairly good at handling. Thereâ€™s a way more troublesome type of conflict we can run 
into when simultaneous changes are made to multiple areas of code that depend upon one another.
Mergify is an automation service for software engineering teams who use GitHub to collaborate. 
It allows engineers to improve their code merging process by defining workflows, queueing merges, and removing manual interventions.
In this workshop you would understand how Mergify works and how Mergify can solve forseen and unforseen bottlenecks in software development lifecycle.
Mergify is FREE for opensource repositories, once you learn the workflow from the next project I am pretty sure you would be using it.
